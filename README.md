========================================

  The client wanted their game to be available cross platform for all players. The client also planned for potentially thousands of concurrent users. To achieve this the client has decided that a web-based application design would be the best option. The constraints set by the client are the game instance must only load a single game profile at a time, the game also must allow users to load into existing games and profiles. During the creation of this document I believe I performed well in the recommendation portion, I looked into the alternative options for this type of application and believe the best options have been outlined for the client.
  While developing the code for "Draw it or Lose it" I found the design constraints as a good reference for reasoning to implement specific features such as a singleton pattern and the RESTful api. The UML diagram was also referenced regularly for development. If I could revise any portion of this document, it would be the evaluation portion. I feel like the format did not allow me to provide extensive reasoning. I used the customers users’ needs when developing this document as a reference point to research and learn about different options for development. The client is hoping to meet the users’ needs as best as possible to have a returning user base. 
  To design this document the approach I used was to evaluate what the client had requested into key points, then find solutions to those key points. For future software design documents, I will use the same concept and do similar research of all available options to find what best serves the client. Though this document is useful for a real-world design document I feel this would be insufficient in the level of detail that would be required.
